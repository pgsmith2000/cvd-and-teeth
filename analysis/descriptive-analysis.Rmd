```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Step 1: Read in the BRFSS 2018 data set and check main variables

```{r echo=TRUE}
source("../code/100_Dependencies.R", echo = TRUE)
source("../code/200_Calculate totals.R", echo = TRUE)

```

## Step 2: Variable Histograms

A histogram was generated for each variable in the study including:

- Reported Cardiovascular Disease - independent (outcome) variable
- Reported Teeth Removed - dependent (exposure) variable
- All studied potential confounders (Sex, Race, Age, Education, Income, Dental Visit, Diabetes, Smoker, Exercise, and BMI Category)

```{r echo=TRUE}
source("../code/205_key variable plots.R", echo = TRUE)
source("../code/206_Confounder plots.R", echo = TRUE)
source("../code/207_More confounder plots.R", echo = TRUE)

```

## Step 3: Frequency Calculations for Table 1

Next, the frequencies were calculated for each variable. These result appear in table 1 below.

3 sets of variable values were examined:

- **Total frequencies** for each variable
- Frequencies each variable for those reporting **Cardiovascular Disease Only**
- Frequencies each variable for those reporting **No Cardiovascular Disease Only**


```{r echo=TRUE}
source("../code/210_Table 1 overall frequencies.R", echo = TRUE)
source("../code/215_Table 1 cv frequencies.R", echo = TRUE)
source("../code/220_Table 1 nocv frequencies.R", echo = TRUE)

```

### Step 4: Calculation of Chi-Squares

Chi-square values were calcualted for all variables. All were significant.

```{r echo=TRUE}
source("../code/230_Table 1 chi squares.R", echo = TRUE)

```

### Step 5: Create Final Table 1

The table below shows the participant counts (frequencies) from the descriptive analysis arrange in a complet Table 1. The table also shows relative percentages, and chi-square significance values. All variables were significant at the p<0.001 level.

This concluded the descriptive analysis.
