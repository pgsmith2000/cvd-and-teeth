## Revisiting the Cross-Sectional Association Between Missing Teeth and Cardiovascular Disease: BRFSS 2018

The relationship between oral health and cardiovascular disease has been an important area of research in the last decade. The objective of the current study is to perform an analysis of BRFSS 2018 data based on the previously published work of R. Constance Wiener and Usha Sambamoorthi from 2010. **This analysis is meant to be an example of the data analysis and R programming techniques required to perform both a descriptive and regression analysis of publically available data.**

In their orignal 2010 analysis, Weiner and Sambamoorth evaluated the association of cardiovascular disease and the number of missing teeth as a risk indicator. In this analysis, the 2018 BRFSS data and initial variables from that study will be used as the basis for demonstrating the products and coding required for (1) an descriptive analysis and (2) a regression analysis using R.

### Stage 1: Data Preparation, Cleaning, and Reduction

The initial data set for the project was the 2018 BRFSS Survey Data, and it was quite large. Before conducting any other analyses to be demonstrated here (such as a desciptive analysis or regression analysis), the data needed some additonal cleaning and reduction. The final result was a data set of 52 variables (compared to the 275 variables in the total set). In addition, the number of records was reduced from over 440,000 records to approximately 266,000 records. The **[2018 BRFSS Codebook CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2018/pdf/codebook18_llcp-v2-508.pdf)** was a key tool in this process.

The three main products of this process included:

- The Main **[Data Dictionary](../output/Data_Dictionary.xlsx)**
- A small **[Data Dictionary Supplement](../output/data_dictionary.txt)**
- The final **[BRFSS Reduced Data Set](../output/BRFSS.csv)**
